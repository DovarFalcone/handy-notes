## Introduction

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a powerful tool for working with relational databases. This repository provides a variety of SQL queries that demonstrate common tasks such as data extraction, transformation, aggregation, and reporting across different platforms: PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Hue.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of SQL and relational databases.
- Access to PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Hue databases.
- SQL client or interface compatible with PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Hue (e.g., SQL command line, GUI tool).

### Clone the Repository

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sql-queries-report.git
```

2. Navigate to the repository's directory:

```bash
cd sql-queries-report
```

## Usage

Browse through the specific platform directories to find categorized lists of SQL query files. Each query file contains a set of SQL queries related to a specific topic or use case. Open the files in your preferred SQL client compatible with the respective platform to execute the queries against your database.

Modify the queries as needed to match your database schema and requirements. Always review and understand the queries before executing them on your database.

## Directories

### postgres

The [postgres](postgres/) directory contains SQL queries specifically designed for PostgreSQL databases. These queries are optimized for PostgreSQL syntax and features.

### mysql

The [mysql](mysql/) directory houses SQL queries tailored for MySQL databases. These queries are structured to work seamlessly with MySQL syntax and features.

### hue

The [hue](hue/) directory hosts SQL queries for Hue, a web-based interface that enables you to query, analyze, and visualize data across multiple platforms. These queries are intended to be run through the Hue interface.

## Contributing

Contributions are encouraged! To contribute your SQL queries, analyses, or reports:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your contribution: `git checkout -b feature/new-queries`
3. Add your query file(s) to the appropriate directory (postgres, mysql, or hue).
4. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Added new queries for PostgreSQL'`
5. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature/new-queries`
6. Create a pull request outlining your changes.

Please ensure your queries are well-documented and formatted for clarity.
