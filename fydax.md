Certainly! If you want to create a measure in Power BI that considers a fiscal year starting in June, you'll need to create a custom column in your Calendar Table to represent the fiscal year, and then create a measure that uses this custom column. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Create a Custom Column for Fiscal Year

1. Open the Power BI Desktop and go to the "Data" view.
2. Find your Calendar Table.
3. Right-click on the table, and select "New Column" from the context menu.
4. Name the column something like "FiscalYear" and use the following DAX formula:

    ```DAX
    FiscalYear = IF(Month(CalendarTable[Date]) >= 6, YEAR(CalendarTable[Date]), YEAR(CalendarTable[Date]) - 1)
    ```

    This formula checks if the month is greater than or equal to June. If it is, it uses the current year; otherwise, it subtracts one.

### Step 2: Create a Measure Using Fiscal Year

Now that you have a custom column representing the fiscal year, you can create a measure that uses it.

1. Switch to the "Data" view if you're not already there.
2. Right-click on your Calendar Table and select "New Measure."
3. Name the measure something like "Total Sales Fiscal Year."

    ```DAX
    Total Sales Fiscal Year = CALCULATE(SUM(YourTableName[Sales]), ALL(CalendarTable), CalendarTable[FiscalYear] = VALUES(CalendarTable[FiscalYear]))
    ```

    Replace "YourTableName" with the actual name of your table and [Sales] with the actual column you want to aggregate.

### Step 3: Use the Measure in Your Reports

Now you can use the "Total Sales Fiscal Year" measure in your reports, and it will consider your fiscal year starting in June.

Remember to adjust the table and column names according to your actual data model. This method provides flexibility, allowing you to easily adapt to different fiscal year start months by changing the number in the IF condition accordingly.
